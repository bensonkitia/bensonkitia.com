    Hi, I'm Benson Kitia, a 15 year old builder in Chicago. I use the pronouns

    Right now, outside of being a full-time student, I'm writing about various
    things here, writing satirical tech news articles at
    <a href="https://thevariant.net">The Variant</a>, learning lots of things,
    and building a new way to discover and share your favorite iOS apps.
